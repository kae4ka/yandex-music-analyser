# Yandex.Music analyzer
### :pencil: What is it for?
Hello there!  
These notebooks based on Last.fm API analyse your listening history.  
I used it to analyse my listening history on Yandex.Music and to practice my programming skills.
### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use it?
First, create an account on Last.fm if you don't have one. <br />
Then create API account on the following link: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create. <br />
To scrobble music from Yandex.Music use the following instructions: https://yandex.by/support/music-app-android/search-and-listen/last-fm.html. <br />
Notice that you have to scrobble your music for a few days to have a dataset. <br />
After that you're ready to launch notebook.
### ü§î Which notebook do I use?
* `top_genres.ipynb` is the oldest one here. It generates you top 10 ~~genres~~ tags of **all** time.  
* `new_version_top_10.ipynb` is the newest one. I wrote it just to practice dataclasses and OOP in Python. It shows your top 10 artists, top 10 songs, top 10 tags by **last week** (of more).
